#Explanation

##PHP
  Visiting: yourwebsite.com/playVideo.php?searchString=YOUR_SEARCH_STRING_FOR_YOUTUBE triggers the script to add the video to your database.

##Python
  Using PyChromeCast (https://github.com/balloob/pychromecast), the python script will run at a set interval, continuously checking the database for new videos. When it detects a new row has been added, it loads youtube-dl, a command-line program to grab the stream URL and passes it to PyChromeCast, which sends it to your ChromeCast.

#Issues
  - Sometimes PyChromecast doesn't detect the chromecasts.

#To Do
  - Kill ChromeCast App
  - Get Duration of Media and allow for playlist.
  - Allow for interuptions in internet and keep running

#Setup
  - Install PyChromecast to your Desired PC (pip install pychromecast)
  - Install build.sql to your MySQL server
  - Get a Youtube API Key (Available [here](https://console.developers.google.com))
  - Replace all connection strings using set-up.py
  - Setup Skill.js In [Lambda](http://aws.amazon.com/)
  - Set up skill in the Alexa Portal at http://developer.amazon.com using sample-utterances.txt and intentSchema.json
  - Run Python Script.
  - Voila!
